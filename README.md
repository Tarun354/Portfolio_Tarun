## 💻 Projects & Research

### 🌀 **Stochastic Template Placement using Low Discrepancy Sequences**  
*SRIP, IIT Gandhinagar — Advisor: Dr. Anand Sengupta*  
- Built a **2D stochastic template bank** in chirp coordinates using a **ball-tree top-down approach**.  
- Demonstrated that **Halton sampling** achieved the same coverage with **5–6% fewer templates** than random sampling.  
- Implemented template placement using **rejection sampling** with √det(g) weighting.  

### ⚙️ **Metric Match Approximation in CBC Template Banks**  
*IIT Gandhinagar — Jan 2025 to Apr 2025*  
- Constructed the **metric in θ₀–θ₃ coordinates** using the Fisher Information Matrix.  
- Compared **metric-based vs exact match contours** for accuracy validation.  
- Reproduced key results from **Allen, Sathyaprakash, and Roy et al.**

### 🌊 **Application of Hilbert–Huang Transform in Gravitational Wave Detection**  
*Advisors: Dr. Anand Sengupta & Dr. Amit Reza (Austrian Academy of Sciences)*  
- Applied **HHT** for GW signal extraction and timing analysis from noisy data.  
- Demonstrated that **IMF1** yields better trigger time estimation than raw data.  
- Explored **HHT’s potential for improving sky localization accuracy**.
